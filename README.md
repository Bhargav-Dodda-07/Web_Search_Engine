 A Web search engine is a specialized computer server that searches for information on the Web. 
 The search results of a user query are often returned as a list (sometimes called hits). 
 The hits may consist of web pages, images, and other types of files. 
 Some search engines also search and return data available in public databases or open directories. 
 Search engines differ from web directories in that web directories are maintained by human editors whereas search engines operate algorithmically or by a mixture of algorithmic and human input.
